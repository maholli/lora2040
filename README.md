# lora2040

Just playing with RP2040 + SX1262 radio.

Will eventually reduce the size and add castellations for "mezzanine" style surface mounting.

Reminders to myself:
- [x] Initial bring-up with Everspin MRAM
  - [ ] Avalanche MRAM
- [x] Full speed SX1262 interface
- [ ] Measure TX output power
- [ ] Measure RX sensitivity
- [ ] Maybe add an amp at some point?
